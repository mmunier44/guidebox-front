### List of Technologies Used: Mongodnb, Express, React & Node.js

### Thought Process, WireFrames and User Stories

For my capstone General Assembly project I focused on creating an web application that had actual functionality beyond your regular crud app.

While browsing around the interwebs for project ideas, I had a moment of thought about current tv guide schedule applications and looked at them.

One of the top google hits for multiple network fall broadcast debuts was a link to a simple calendar page that just simply listed networks and tv show names.

I looked around for 3rd party API's that aggregated network shows in a good format and found out that there really were not any that had any functionality.

Then I stumbled upon GuideBox a new startup with an API still in private beta that did all of what I was looking for, ease universal search and discovery of all video content all in one destination.

I emailed their dev team explaining that I was a web dev immersive student and asked for student access to their closed beta.

Within a couple days one of their dev's reached out to me and offered me a free 30 day access to their API and some great words of encouragement about starting up my web development career, and I was off!

Using GuideBox as an inspiration I used the MERN stack as an introduction to the world of React and was hooked after creating my first functional component.

Version 3

For the MVP version I wanted a simple clean interface where a user could create a list of linked video url's.

Thats it really simple and using React it was actually a lot of fun building the smaller components and then fitting them all in together.

For version 2, I wanted the user to be able to upload a video to a cloud storage facility and then be able to login to any device and remote access/download that video.

Then the user would be able to set up a personal landing page with tiled video's that would all be playable from different sources on one landing page.

For version 3, I wanted to integrate the network and scheduling information from GuideBox API and create a personalized tv watching page with active links to ongoing network websites.

Working with React was amazing and I fully plan on iterating through the rest of my versions.

### Developer Evolution Goals
UX/UI
Upload
3rd party API integration
Use React even more!
